This is based on a fascinating canvas animation with tiny code posted by Joachim Viide [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jviide/status/1574061206964412417).

The file `original.js` contains the original code. The file `main.js` is a refactorization and slight variation of that code supplemented by comments which explain what is actually happening.
